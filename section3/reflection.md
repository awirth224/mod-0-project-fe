## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
It was definitely harder this section that last. There were points were I felt completely stuck even after researching an answer and needed to ask someone for help.
2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
My bank app uses arrays for my selected account transactions.
3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a way to manipulate/change or gather information about your array.
4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop runs a condition the amount of times it is set, while adding or removing a set quantity each time until the condition evaluates as false.
5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
I would show a 5 year old a timer. The person who has the time decides how many seconds they want to set the timer for, example of 10. Then when you press start (or run the code) the timer counts down by one second and each second is a loop.
6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
How do I connect an array of strings to other strings (not a variable) to print in a loop?
