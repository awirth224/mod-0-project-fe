## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I usually ask questions too soon. I will practice using a timebox to find the answer on my own first.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
Booleans, which is either true or false. Numbers which are all numbers: positive, negative and decimals. And string,
which are letters, numbers or symbols, wrapped in quotations.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!")
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
"//" for single line comments and /* <comment> */ for multi-line comments. Code comments give context and additional information regarding the code .
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is what you use to hold data. If I were to explain it to a 5 year old, I would describe it as a containter. You decide what you want to put in the container and what you will label the container (both need to happen). Then U would give an example to help the child understand: This container is labeled "toyCars" and what we put in it (data) are only toy cars.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
I use my photos app a lot. The album name would be considered a string data type, the number of photos in an album would be a number data type and whether a photo is in that specific album (true/false) or not is a boolean.
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is a way to link together strings and variable(s) using the "+" operator.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
When I launch a game app that I play it says "Welcome back, Angie" and the developers probably used concatenation like this:
var name = Angie
console.log("Welcome back," + name + "!")
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
When reading the comparisons, I was very confused on comparisons of different types and strict equality. Why is 0 false and 1 is true? Is that just the example or always the case?
